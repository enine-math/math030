# Problem No. 30

## Digit Fifth Powers

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

$$\begin{align}
1634 &amp;= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\\
8208 &amp;= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4\\
9474 &amp;= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{align}$$

$1 = 1^4$ is not a sum and is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$.

## Part A

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Part B

Can you generalize the solution in Part A to find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of the nth powers of their digits?

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your generalized solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math030`

Copy README.md and solution.py into `math030`

Share your solution by updating `answer()` and `solver()` in solution.py.
